Subject: your ${role} role in the ${project} project

Hello, 
 
I saw that you are interested in the ${role} role in the ${project} 
project. 
 
I'm very interested in having other people in the project, but at the 
same time, it's bit hard to approve a request without even knowing who 
you are. 
 
So if you could introduce me who you are and perhaps tell me a bit about 
your plan with the ${project} project, that would be greatly appreciated.
